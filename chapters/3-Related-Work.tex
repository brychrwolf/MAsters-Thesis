\chapter{Related Work}
As mentioned in the introduction of Chapter~\ref{ch1}, there are not yet many options for those persons wanting to filter scalar fields on discrete 2D meshes embedded in 3D. However research has been done in related fields including copious amounts of research didcated to 2D filters, work on gaussian blurring, smoothing and diffusion processes of which \forf{t} belongs. Also realted to the research presented in this thesis are other approaches to implementing concurrent and parallel software, including

...while not many exist, these are the ones that do.
