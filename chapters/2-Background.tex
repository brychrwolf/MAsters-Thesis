\chapter{Background}
\label{ch2}
\Forf{T} relies on the research from many fields of study in both mathematics and computer science. In this chapter we will briefly examine the underlying theory, concepts, and frameworks upon which we rely to convey the ideas presented in this thesis and bring to fruition the work invested in designing and developing \forf{t}.

\section{Basic Theory}\todoReword{theoretical foundation}
The following is an abbreviated list of the important theoretical concepts used in the chapters to follow. These include concepts from set theory, geometry, and topology.

%
%
\subsection{Set Theory}
A set is one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics. Informally, a set is a collection of distinct objects, and is also itself considered to be an object. In this thesis, sets are denoted using capital, calligraphic letters, such as: $\bM$, $\bP$, $\bT$, and $\bF$.

%
\subsubsection{Set Definitions}
A set may be defined using ``intensional definitions'' or ``extensional definitions''. An intensional definition uses semantic rules and symbols, where each symbol can be translated into words so that the definition may be coherently read aloud. For example:
%
\begin{equation}
	\bP := \left \{\:\bp_v \mid v \in \mathbb{N}, \;\text{and}\; 1\leq v \leq v_{max}\:\right \}
\end{equation}
%
which should be read as, ``$\bP$ is defined as the set of all points $\bp_v$, such that the index $v$ is a member of the set of natural numbers, and $v$ is a number from 1 to the maximum index of points in the set.''

The other option, extensional definition, is denoted by enclosing the list of members in curly brackets, and optionally invoking an ellipsis (``\dots'') for continuing into infinity. For example:
%
\begin{equation}
	\mathbb{N} = \left \{\:0,\,1,\,2,\,3,\,\ldots\:\right \}
\end{equation}
%
A set member is allowed to be listed two or more times in a definition, for example $\left \{\:4,\,2,\,2\:\right \}$. However, it is identical to the set $\left \{\:4,\,2\:\right \}$ per the axiom of extensionality\todoResearch{Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory., Axiom of extensionality, logical extensionality}, which states that two definitions of sets, which differ only in that one of the definitions lists members multiple times, define the same set.

%
\subsubsection{Special Sets}
There exists some sets which are used in mathematical literature with such frequency as to demand their own standardized symbols. In this thesis\todoReference{defineSetofNaturalNumbers}, we have already encountered $\mathbb{N}$, which denotes the set of all natural numbers.

%
\subsubsection{Cardinality}
Denoted as $|\bM\,|$, the cardinality of a set is the number of its members, so if $\bM = \left \{\,\bP,\,\bT\right \}$, then $|\bM\,| = 2$.

%
\subsubsection{Membership \& Relational Operators}
If an object is said to be a member of a set, it is written with the symbol $\in$ and expressed as either belonging to or being an element of the set. Similarly, a set may be the subset of another set, written with the symbol $\subseteq$, meaning that every member of the first set is also a member of second set. A superset works exactly in reverse, written with the symbol $\subseteq$, it is the identity where every member of the second set is also a member of first set. In mathematical notation, those examples are written as\footnote{The negative operators also exists as $\notin$ and $\nsubseteq$}
\begin{align}
	B & \in \left \{A,\,B,\,C\right \} \\
	\left \{A,\,B\right \} & \subseteq \left \{A,\,B,\,C\right \} \\
	\left \{A,\,B,\,C\right \} & \supseteq \left \{A,\,B\right \}
\end{align}

%
\subsubsection{Binary Operations}
Among all the basic binary operations one can perform on a set\footnote{which are the union, intersection, complement, and Cartesian product}, in this thesis, we exclusively use the union operation, denoted as $\cup$, whose output is the set of all objects that are members of either set, or both. For example:
\begin{equation}
	\left \{0,\,1,\,2\right \} \cup \left \{2,\,3,\,4\right \} = \left \{0,\,1,\,2,\,3,\,4\right \}
\end{equation}
\todoReword{would look better to have words here}
As a final note, a ``family of sets'' is very similar to a superset, with only the subtle difference that all the subsets it contains should have some quality in common. For example, in Section~\ref{ch2s3ssNRN} we will define the set of sets of neighbors as a family of sets, with the common quality being that all the subsets are neighborhoods.

%
%
%
\subsection{Geometry}
As vast and encompassing is geometry as a field of study, of paramount importance for \forf{t} are interpolation, the concept of a geodesic disc, and the characteristics of a circle sector.
\todoResearch{weighted averaging using density}

%
\subsubsection{Interpolation \& Extrapolation}
\todoBackground{add text and figure for extrapolation}
Simply stated, interpolation is a method of constructing new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points, such as those points used in \tdd{}. There exist a large variety of methods for interpolating different kinds of data\todoCitation{different kinds of interpolation}, but as an introduction, let us first consider linear interpolation, which is simple to calculate\footnote{however can become imprecise in relation to the square of the distance between the data points.}\todoCitation{footnote:error of linear interpolation} and can be extended for n-dimensions\todoCitation{n-dimensional linear interpolation}.

Given the two data points in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $(x_a, y_a)$ and $(x_b, y_b)$, the so called interpolant of a point located at\todoReword{interpolant is wrong, don't use point located at, maybe value sampled at instead?} $x_c$ can be calculated as
%
\begin{equation}
	y_c = y_a + (y_b - y_a) \frac{x_c - x_a}{x_b - x_a}
	\label{eq:interpolationGeneral}
\end{equation}

To illustrate the concept of interpolation, consider the two points $(1, 2)$ and $(5, 1)$, then find the $y$ value of a point located along the line $x = 3$
%
\begin{align}
	y_c & = 2 + (1 - 2) \frac{3 - 1}{5 - 1} \\
	& = 2 + -1 \frac{2}{4} \enspace = \enspace  1.5
	\label{eq:interpolationSpecific}
\end{align}

So the value halfway between the two given points is interpolated to be $(2,\,2.5)$, which is halfway between as expected. Interpolation becomes even more intuitive when seen graphically as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:interpolation}.

\begin{figure}
\ffigbox
	{\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/interpolation.png}}
	{\caption[Interpolation between two points in $\mathbb{R}^2$]{$\bp_c$ is interpolated as a value between $\bp_a$ and $\bp_b$}\label{fig:interpolation}}
\end{figure}

%
\subsubsection{Geodesic Discs}
\label{ch2sBssGsssGD}
\todoResearch{geodesic discs}
Geodesic Disc $\bO$%
\nomenclature[aa]{$\bO$}{a geodesic disc}%
\nomenclature[ab]{$\bO_v$}{a specific geodesic disc centered about the point $\bp_v$}%

%
\subsubsection{Circle Sectors}
\label{ch2sBssGsssCS}
A circular sector, or circle sector, is the portion of a disc enclosed by two radii and an arc. In general, the larger area is known as the major sector, however \forf{t} is only concerned with the area of the other, smaller area, known as the minor sector. Going forward, the minor circle sector will be abbreviated as just the circle sector, or even more simply, the sector. In general, we will denoted sectors as $\bs$, or $bs_i$ in reference to a specific circle sector in a geodesic disc $\bO$.%
\nomenclature[ba]{``the sector''}{or the circle sector; the minor sector of a circle defined by its radius and central angle}%
\nomenclature[bb]{$\bs$}{a circle sector}%
\nomenclature[bc]{$\bs_i$}{specific circle sector in a specific geodesic disc $\bO$}%

As the sector can be described entirely by the central angle $\alpha$ and the circle's radius $\ell_{a,b}$, the area of the sector can be given as
%
\begin{equation}
	A = \pi \ell_{a,b}^2\frac{\alpha}{2\pi} = \frac{\ell_{a,b}^2\alpha}{2}
	\label{eq:areaOfCircleSector}
\end{equation}
%
because the area of the sector can be obtained by multiplying the circle's total area by the ratio of the sector's central angle $\alpha$, and $2\pi$, the total angle of the circle in radians.~\cite{Weisstein19d}%
\nomenclature[bd]{$A$}{an area of a circular sector}%

%
\subsubsection{Center of Gravity}
\label{ch2sBssGsssCS}
Along with area, the other important characteristic of a circle sector for \forf{t} is the centroid, or center of gravity. So named, because it is the point where the sector would balance on a pin\footnote{given that it had been bestowed a volume with uniform density}. The center of gravity $\bc$ is calculated as the distance from the center point $\bp_a$, along the line which bisects the central angle $\alpha$, or is given by
%
\begin{equation}
	\check{\ell} := \frac{4\:\gelm\:\sin(\frac{\alpha_i}{2})}{3\,\alpha_i}
	\label{eq:ch2distToCoG}
\end{equation}%
\nomenclature[ca]{$\check{\ell}$}{the distance from $\bp_0$ to $\bc$}%

This line which bisects the center angle of a circle sector, while not used explicitly in calculations, is an important concept for much of the computations used by \forf{t}, as will be seen in Chapter~\ref{ch4}. Therefore, we make a special note here that the abbreviated, "bisecting line," indeed refers to this line which splits the circle sector, and its central angle $\alpha$, into two equivalent halves.%
\nomenclature[cb]{``bisecting line''}{the line which bisects the center angle of a circle sector}%

In the Figure~\ref{fig:circleSector}, a circle sector is produced by the points $\bp_a$, $\bp_b$, and $\bp_c$, has the central angle $\alpha$, which is bisected by a dotted line, and $\ell_{a,b}$\footnote{$\ell_{a,b}$ was chosen to represent the radius instead of the much more common $r$, because in \tdd{}, edges are not stored, yet distances between points can be calculated as shown in Section~\ref{ch2s3ssEL}} representing the length between points $\bp_a$ and $\bp_b$, which is equal radius of the circle. Also shown, is the center of gravity $\bc$, as well as $\check{\ell}$, the distance to $\bc$ from the center point $\bp_a$.

Also labeled is the center of gravity $\bc$ as well as the distance from the center point $\bp_a$ to $\bc$, drawn in a coral color as $\check{\ell}$}\label{fig:circleSector}}

\subsection{Topology}
\label{ch2sBssT}
Topology is the mathematical study of the properties of space that are preserved through deformations, twistings, and stretchings of objects\footnote{but not tearing or gluing}, which developed as a field of study from geometry and set theory through analysis of concepts such as space, dimension, and transformation. For example, a circle is topologically equivalent to an ellipse, because it can be deformed by stretching.~\cite{Weisstein19c} Of the major concepts, this thesis is most concerned with manifolds and neighborhoods.

%
\subsubsection{Manifolds}
A manifold is a topological space that is locally, but possibly not globally, Euclidean; a concept that is central to many parts of geometry because it allows complicated structures, such as the triangle mesh, to be described and understood in terms of the simpler, local topological properties. In general, that means that a manifold is an $n$D-subset of an Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{>n}$.~\cite[p.~199]{Mara12} For example, 1-dimensional manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ include lines and circles, and 2-dimensional manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, also called surfaces, can include commonly-known shapes such as the plane, the sphere, and the torus, but also of prime importance for this thesis, the triangle mesh.

%
\subsubsection{Neighborhoods}
A neighborhood is also one of the basic concepts of topology. Intuitively speaking, a neighborhood of a point is a set of points containing that point, where one can move in any direction without leaving the set. While determining the neighborhood is trivial for 1-dimensional manifolds, and relatively simple to regular surfaces, such as a 2D-images whose pixels have at most four neighbors in orthogonal directions with a geometric distance of 1, as well as four neighbors at the diagonal directions with a geometric distance of $\sqrt{2}$, determining the neighborhood becomes more complicated for irregular surfaces like those found in \tdd{}. With those surfaces, one must determine the set of neighbors using the associations that define the triangular faces; the details of which are covered in detail in Section:~\ref{ch2s3ssNRN}, after the necessary topics regarding \tdd{} have already been discussed.

Figure~\ref{fig:neighborhoods} illustrates the difference among a one-ring neighborhood in two kinds of regular meshes, as well as one in an irregular mesh as found in \tdd{}. In particular, notice the completely arbitrary shape and size of the one-ring neighborhood found in (c) irregular triangle mesh; even the number of neighbors can varies widely. From this observation is where the motivation behind \forf{t} came.

\section{\tdd}
\label{ch2s3}
\todoStyle{the 3 in \tdd{} looks too small}
The data upon which one convolves \forf{t} is called \tdd\todoCitation{\tdd{} name origin, BB82 from Mara12}. As described in Section~\ref{ch2s3ssM}, \tdd{} consists primarily of a single mesh $\bM$, which is the superset of $\bP$, a set of points, and the set $\bT$ consisting of triangular faces, each to be covered in Sections~\ref{ch2s3ssP} and~\ref{ch2s3ssF} respectively. \tdd{} also comes in two distinct flavors depending on its origin: acquired or synthetic, as discussed in Section~\ref{ch2s3ssAVS3}. The data can also include a texture map and other various types of information stored as scalar or vector fields, as elaborated on in~\ref{ch2s3ssFV}.

%
%
%
\subsection{Points}
\label{ch2s3ssP}
A point $\bp$ is the most primitive element of \tdd{}. "Point" is the abbreviated form of "measuring point", and is also known in other fields of study as a vertex, or a position vector $\in \mathbb{R}^3$\todoCitation{other names for a point}. A point is defined by the 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$ and $z$, and in \tdd{}, points are generally unique and not required to be in any particular order. In this thesis, a point is addressed using several different subscripts, depending on the context.

Index $v$ is the globally unique index, with which we can define the set
%
\begin{equation}
	\bP := \left \{\:\bp_v \mid v \in \mathbb{N}, \;\text{and}\; 1\leq v \leq v_{max}\:\right \}
	\label{eq:defineSetOfPoints}
\end{equation}
%
where $v_{max}$ is the maximum index\footnote{Beginning indices with 1 is significant because of the discordant conventions between addressing the first element of a data structure with 0 in programming languages, such as C++ and python, versus addressing first elements with 1, as is the standard for mathematical literature. Because this thesis should indeed be considered mathematical literature, we will always start indices at 1, and only use index 0 for special cases. For example, $\bp_0$ is used in Chapter~\ref{ch4} to represent the center point of the one-ring neighborhood.} of points in the data, and is equivalent to the cardinality of the set of points $|\bP|$.%
\nomenclature[ea]{$\bP$}{the set of points $\bp$ in $\bM$}%
\nomenclature[eb]{$\bp_v$}{a specific point in $\bP$}%

Otherwise, when referencing to a point within a particular face or neighborhood, the three corners can be referenced indirectly as $\bp_i$\footnote{or generally as $\bp_a$, $\bp_b$, $\bp_c$ in the case of Equation~\ref{eq:defineEdgeLengthFace}, or in the case of a nested loops: as $\bp_i$ in Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialBuildNeighborhoods}, and $\bp_j$ in Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialCompute}}, $\bp_{\sipo}$, and $\bp_{\sipt}$, or directly as $\bp_1$, $\bp_2$, and $\bp_3$.~\cite[p.~25]{Mara12}%
\todoReword{ensure footnote indices remain correct}%
\nomenclature[ec]{$\bp_i$}{also $\bp_{\sipo}$, and $\bp_{\sipt}$; one of three indirectly referenced points comprising a face}%

%
%
%
\subsection{Faces}
\label{ch2s3ssF}
Faces are the another primitive element of \tdd{}. As we are working exclusively with triangular meshes~\cite[p.~26]{Mara12}, we define a face $\bt$ by the totally ordered~\cite{Weisstein19a} set of three distinct points, which we will index in clockwise order\footnote{It is worth mentioning here that many software packages, such as the GigaMesh Framework~\cite[p.~89]{Mara12}, may expect counter-clockwise ordering of indexes.  This is significant because the ordering provides an orientation by which visualization software can apply texture and/or lighting. The only mathematical significance of the ordering is the sign of the area of a face, and totally inconsequential when the absolute value is expected, as shown by\cite[p.~2]{Braden86}. This is yet another example of the difference between the conventions of mathematical literature versus those of computer science. And again, because this thesis should indeed be considered mathematical literature, we will continue to follow the conventions of mathematical literature.}~\cite[p.~4]{Mara17}.
\todoResearch{does the "right-hand-rule apply here?"}
%
\begin{equation}
	\bt := \left \{\,\bp_a,\,\bp_b,\,\bp_c\right \} = \left \{\,\bp_1,\,\bp_2,\,\bp_3\right \}
	\label{eq:defineSetOfFaces}
\end{equation}

With the introduction of faces comes the concept of adjacency. A face $\bt_i$ is said to be adjacent to another face $\bt_j$ if, and only if, they share the same subset of two points. Similarly, a point $\bp_a$ is said to be adjacent to another point $\bp_b$ if, and only if, the set $\{\bp_a, \bp_b\}$ is a subset of at least one face $\bt \in \bT$. A synonym for adjacent is ``neighboring,'' and this thesis will use both interchangeably. \todoReword{add equation for these identities}\todoReword{index entry for adjacent}

The Figure~\ref{fig:triangularFaces} shows two adjacent triangular faces $\bt_1$ and $\bt_2$, and the relationship between their points $\bp_a$, $\bp_b$, and $\bp_c$, their edge lengths $\ell_a$, $\ell_b$, and $\check{\ell}$, and their clockwise orientation.

\end{figure}

Each distinct triangular face is addressed using the global index $k$, and when taken together, comprise the set
%
\begin{equation}
	\bT := \left \{\:\bt_k \mid k \in \mathbb{N}, \;\text{and}\; 1\leq k \leq k_{max}\:\right \}
	\label{eq:defineSetOfFaces}
\end{equation}
%
where $k_{max}$ is the maximum index of faces in the data, and is equivalent to the cardinality of the set of faces $|\bT|$.%
\nomenclature[fa]{$\bT$}{the set of faces $\bt$ in $\bM$}%
\nomenclature[fb]{$\bt_k$}{a specific face in $\bT$}%

%
%
%
\subsection{Edge Lengths}
\label{ch2s3ssEL}
As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:triangularFaces}, each triangular face is implicitly composed of three edges. Despite the fact that an edge is not typically\footnote{Other data structures, such as the Winged-Edge~\cite[p.~1]{Baumgart75}, may use edges as a primitive element} a primitive element of \tdd{}, we will endeavor to define the length of an edge $\ell$, because edge lengths are of particular significance for both the design and implementation of \forf{t}.

What is also particularly interesting about Figure~\ref{fig:triangularFaces}, is that when edge lengths are defined by the points of specific faces, each non-border edge length, illustrated by the figure as $\ell_a$ in $\bt_1$, and $\check{\ell}$ in $\bt_2$, will be labeled twice, despite representing the same distance.

When in the context of a particular face $\bt_k$, we will use a single index to define the length
%
\begin{equation}
	\ell_a := |\bp_b - \bp_c| \enspace:\enspace \left \{\,\bp_a,\,\bp_b,\,\bp_c\right \} = \bt_k
	\label{eq:defineEdgeLengthFace}
\end{equation}%
\nomenclature[ga]{$\ell_i$}{the length of edge $\ell_i$ of a specific face}%
%
and double indices when an edge length is referenced in relation to a specific point $\bp_v$ and its neighbor $\bp_i$
%
\begin{equation}
	\ell_{\sv{i}} := |\bp_i - \bp_v|
	\label{eq:defineEdgeLengthPoint}
\end{equation}%
\nomenclature[gb]{$\ell_{\sv{i}}$}{the length of distance from point $\bp_v$ to $\bp_i$}%

Please note the similar notation for the cardinality of a set $|\bP|$, to that for the calculation for the length of the edge $|\bp_i - \bp_v|$ as defined in Equation~\ref{eq:defineEdgeLengthPoint}. While cardinality is simply the count of elements in the set, the length is calculated as the L2-norm of the referenced vector.~\cite[p.~26]{Mara12}

%\begin{align}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	|\bp_i - \bp_v| & = \lVert\bp_i - \bp_v\rVert_2 \\
					& = \sqrt{(x_i-x_v)^2 + (y_i-y_v)^2 + (y_i-y_v)^2}
	\label{eq:defineEdgeLengthCalc}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%\end{align}

%
\subsection{Meshes}
\label{ch2s3ssM}
In \tdd{}, a mesh $\bM$ is the digital representation of a discrete manifold embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$, and is typically\footnote{except in the case of specifically designed synthetic data~\ref{Experiments}} 2D-non-planar\todoStyle{in 2D, the 2 looks small} and comprised of non-regular, triangular faces composed of connected points.~\cite[p.~25]{Mara12} A mesh is the superset defined as
%
\begin{equation}
	\bM := \left \{\bP,\:\bT\right \}
	\label{eq:defineMesh}
\end{equation}%
\nomenclature[da]{$\bM$}{a mesh; the superset including the sets of all points $\bp$ and faces $\bt$}%
%
with the set $\bP$ consisting of points, and the set $\bT$ consisting of triangular faces.

Many 3D-scanners produce point clouds\todoCitation{}{}, which as the name suggests, are comprised soley of a set of points $\bP$ and do not provide the set $\bT$. However, it is possible, and necessary for the production of a mesh, to perform a point set triangulation\todoCitation{}{} in order to connect $\bP$ into a set of triangle faces, enabling one to combine the two sets into a mesh~\cite[p.~26]{Mara12}. For example, during our experiments, we perform the well-known Delaunay triangulation\todoCitation{} in order to produce a mesh from a randomly generated point cloud\todoReword{add ref to experiments}.

%
%
%
\subsection{One-ring Neighborhoods}
\label{ch2s3ssORN}
It was mentioned in Section~\ref{ch2sBssT}, that determining the neighborhood of a point $\bp_v$ is non-trivial. Having now examined the definitions of points, faces, and meshes, we can now formalize the one-ring neighborhood in \tdd{} as
%
\begin{equation}
	\bN_v := \left \{\;\bp_i\;|\;\left \{\,\bp_i,\,\bp_v\right \} \subseteq \bt \quad \forall \bt \in \bT\;\right \}
	\label{eq:defineNeighborhood}
\end{equation}%
\nomenclature[ha]{$\bN_v$}{the set of points comprising the one-ring neighborhood about $\bP_v$}%
\nomenclature[hb]{$\bp_i$}{a one-ring neighbor of $\bP_v$}%
\todoStyle{consider changing font of N to imply FAMILY of sets, not just a set}
\todoBackground{add $\subseteq$}
%
which in words, means that the neighborhood $\bN_v$ is defined as the set of points $\bp_i$ such that both $\bp_i$ and $\bp_v$ are two points of a triangular face $\bt$, for all faces in the mesh.

When taken together, all the neighborhoods $\bN_v$ comprise a set of sets of neighbors; the family of sets $\bN$, with the common quality being that all the subsets are neighborhoods. The cardinality of each neighborhood $|\bN_v|$ will likely vary among other neighborhoods in $\bM$, however, the value and must always be $\geq 2$, and though there is no upper limit, $|\bN_v|$ is typically $\leq 12$. Furthermore, the neighboring points are always indexed in a clockwise direction for the same reasons as discussed in Section~\ref{ch2s3ssF}.
\nomenclature[hc]{$\bN$}{a family of sets of neighborhoods}%
\todoResearch{get real upper limit for n}.%

As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:neighborhoods}, the set of black points are the $\bp_i$ which belong to $\bN_v$, what is known as a one-ring neighborhood of $\bp_v$, because they are directly connected with the center point $\bp_v$ drawn in coral color. The moniker originates from graph theory where each adjacent point is said to have a relative distance of 1 within the graph\todoReword{do I need graph theory in basic theory section?} of the mesh. The one-ring can be extended to a 2-ring by taking the union of the neighborhood $\bN_v$ with each neighborhood of each one-ring neighbor $\bp_i$, which adds points having the relative distance of 2 within the graph. This iterative concept can be repeated k times and the neighborhood is than referred to as k-ring. Unfortunately, the relative distance within the graph can not be assumed equal to the geometric distance nor geodesic distance, regardless of that fact, it is used throughout the literature â€“ especially in the field of Computer Graphics.~\cite[p.~29]{Mara12}

Our solution for computing \forf{t} in light of these complications is explained in greater detail in Chapter~\ref{ch4}, later in this thesis.

\subsection{Acquired vs Synthetic \tdd{}}
\label{ch2s3ssAVS3}
The corpus of \tdd{} exists in two flavors, acquired and synthetic data, with each being handily classifiable by the fashion in which it was generated, and the characteristics innate to those techniques.\todoReword{consider adding a figure here showing difference, or referencing a figure or pair of figures that does}

Acquired \tdd{} is typically captured as a point cloud utilizing various methods, such as: LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), Structured Light, or Structure from Motion~\cite[p.~19]{Mara12}. Then the data is exported from software packages accompanying the 3D-scanners as either just the point cloud as a simple set of points $\bP$, or optionally as a triangle mesh $\bM$, described by one or more scalar-fields. Acquired \tdd{} also often consists upwards of a million points and as many as twice that number of faces\todoReference{the interesting experimental finding about face to vertex ratio; add as a footnote}. These exported meshes ~\cite[p.~25]{Mara12} uniformly contain noise and may exhibit other complexities for analysis, such as: non-manifold points, multiple borders and holes in the surface, inverted face orientation, non-manifold edges, and agglutination or degenerate faces. ~\cite[p.~28-32]{Mara12}

Conversely, synthetic \tdd{} is artfully crafted to obey the constraints of being a good mesh\todoReword{define a good mesh here}, without the complexities exhibited by acquired data. When modeling 3-dimensional objects, synthetic \tdd{} can require significantly less memory for storage, as simplifications can be made for large regular surfaces. For example, even the largest flat, rectangular surface can be modeled with only four points and two faces, whereas the acquired data methods require that the Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem\todoCitation{Nyquist Shannon Theorem} be obeyed for the smallest detectable feature throughout the entire surface.~\cite[p.~19]{Mara12}~\cite[p.~3]{Mara17}

For our experiments\todoReference{experiments}, we created another kind of synthetic \tdd{} which does not model a 3D-object. Instead, these synthetic-mesh generators produce different types of tessellations on arbitrarily large, planar surfaces, accompanied by a configurable scalar-field of function values.

\subsection{Function Values}

In addition to the 3 Cartesian coordinates, a point may often contain other relevant data in the form of scalar fields, or when taken together, vector fields. This information, which is stored at each point $\bp$, often includes data regarding: RGB color, material type, reflectivity, transparency, quality, confidence, or the resulting function values from an analytical filter such as the Multi-Scale Integral Invariants (MSII) filter~\cite[p.~21]{Mara12}, but can be extended to include data important to other fields of study, such as: infrared or ultraviolet light, temperature, rainfall, population, crime-rates, etc; essentially, any kind of data that may be measured at a point. As \forf{t} will currently\todoReference{future work/applications} only process a single field at a time, we can define a scalar field simply as the set of function values
%
\begin{equation}
	\bF := \left \{\: f_v \mid v \in \mathbb{N}, \;\text{and}\; 1\leq v \leq v_{max} \:\right \}
	\label{eq:defineSetOfFunctionValues}
\end{equation}%
\nomenclature[ia]{$\bF$}{the set of function values $f$; a scalar field}%
\nomenclature[ib]{$f_v$}{a specific function value in $\bF$, corresponding to $\bp_v$}%
%
This definition shares the indices $v$ and $v_{max}$ with the definition for a set of points, Equation~\ref{eq:defineSetOfPoints}. Indeed, it is a fact that the cardinality of $|\bF|$ must be equal to $|\bP|$
%
\begin{equation}
	|\bF| \mbeq |\bP|
\end{equation}
%
because function values are only stored alongside the Cartesian coordinates, 1-for-1 with points, due to \tdd{} existing as a discrete manifold.\todoResearch{storing data between points on a discrete manifold}

\subsection{Serial Computation \& Threads}
%thread can be identified using a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three-dimensional thread index, forming a one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or three- dimensional block of thread, called a thread block. This provides a natural way to invoke computation across the elements in a domain such as a vector, matrix, or volume. However, a kernel can be executed by multiple equally-shaped thread blocks, so that the total number of thread is equal to the number of thread per block times the number of blocks. thread blocks are required to execute independently: It must be possible to execute them in any order, in parallel or in series. This independence requirement allows thread blocks to be scheduled in any order across any number of cores as illustrated by Figure 5, enabling programmers to write code that scales with the number of cores.

%\begin{equation}
%	N = input size (num. ops)
%	P = processor count
%	Ts(N) = Sequential execution time
%	Tbest(N) = Optimal execution time
%	TP(N, P) = Parallel runtime
%\end{equation}

\subsection{Speedup, efficiency}
%	Speedup:
%S(N, P) = Tbest(N)/TP(N, P)

%	Efficiency:
%E(N, P) = Tbest (N)/PTP(N, P) = S/P

%	Costs:
