\chapter{Background}
\label{ch2}
As computational geometry is based on many other fields of study in both mathematics and computer science, so does \Fors{t} also rely on their foundation. In this chapter we will briefly examine the underlying theory, concepts, and frameworks upon which the research was founded in order to develop this filter and implement with parallel processing, its convolution over a mesh of acquired \tdd{}, and upon which we will depend to convey the ideas presented in this thesis.

\section{Elementary Theoretical Basis}
\label{ch2sETB}
In this section, an abbreviated list of the important theoretical concepts, are described. These concepts, which are used throughout the rest of this chapter and the remainder of this thesis, include: set theory in Section~\ref{ch2sETBssST}, linear algebra in Section~\ref{ch2sETBssLA}, geometry in Section~\ref{ch2sETBssG}, and topology in Section~\ref{ch2sETBssT}.

\subsection{Set Theory}
\label{ch2sETBssST}
A set is one of the most fundamental concepts in mathematics. Informally, a set is a collection of distinct objects, and is also itself considered to be an object. In this thesis, sets are denoted using capital, calligraphic letters, including: $\bE$, $\bF$, $\bM$, $\fM$, $\bN$, $\bP$, and $\bT$; each of which will be defined and described in detail when introduced individually later in this thesis. In this section, we will introduce the concepts and nomenclature used to define a set, reference special sets, determine the cardinality of a set, as well as apply membership, relational, and binary operators on sets.

%
%
\subsubsection{Set Definitions}
\label{ch2sETBssSTsssSD}
As several different sets are used throughout the remainder of the thesis, we must first discuss how it is one may define a set and its membership, including ``intensional definitions'' and ``extensional definitions''. An intensional definition uses semantic rules and symbols, where each symbol can be translated into words so that the definition may be coherently read aloud. For example:
%
\begin{equation}
	\bP := \left \{\:\bp_v \mid v \in \mathbb{N}, \;\text{and}\; 1\leq v \leq v_{max}\:\right \}
\end{equation}
%
which should be read as, ``the set $\bP$ is defined as the set of all points $\bp_v$, such that the index $v$ is a member of the set of natural numbers, and $v$ is a number from 1 to the maximum index of points in the set.''

The other option, extensional definition, is denoted by enclosing the list of members in curly brackets, and optionally invoking an ellipsis (``\dots'') for continuing into infinity. For example:
%
\begin{equation}
	\mathbb{N} = \left \{\:0,\,1,\,2,\,3,\,\ldots\:\right \}
\end{equation}
%
which in words, means ``the set of natural numbers, is the set which includes every integer from zero\footnote{In some literature, zero is excluded from the set of natural numbers.} until infinity.''

It is allowed to list a set member two or more times in a definition, for example $\left \{\:4,\,2,\,2\:\right \}$. However, it is identical to the set $\left \{\:4,\,2\:\right \}$ per the axiom of extensionality\todoResearch{Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel set theory., Axiom of extensionality, logical extensionality}, which states that two definitions of sets, which differ only in that one of the definitions lists members multiple times, define the same set.

%
%
\subsubsection{Special Sets}
\label{ch2sETBssSTsssSS}
There exists some sets which are used in mathematical literature with such frequency as to demand their own standardized symbols. In this thesis\todoReference{defineSetofNaturalNumbers}, we have already encountered $\mathbb{N}$, which denotes the set of all natural numbers, but more often, we will use the set of all real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, which can be described as ``the set of all positive or negative, rational or irrational numbers, including zero''; in short, any number which is not imaginary. This special set, is also usually written with a superscript denoting a specific dimensionality, as in $\bR{3}$ for three-dimensional data.

%
%
\subsubsection{Cardinality}
\label{ch2sETBssSTsssC}
Many times throughout this thesis, we will reference the cardinality of set, which simply means the total count of its membership, and is denoted by two enclosing bars. For example, if $\bM$ is defined as the set $\left \{\,\bP,\,\bT\right \}$, then $|\bM\,| $, read the cardinality of $\bM$, equals two. Cardinality is a very important metric\footnote{Closely related to cardinality, is the concept of a census, which as used in this thesis, is devoid of any special symbol, but is defined as the total count of all members, of every member, of a multidimensional set or family of sets. An algorithm for computing a census is even presented in Section~\ref{ch6sBNPssPRCN}.} for the research conducted for this thesis, for example, in reasoning about the number of faces in a mesh, or discussing the count of points in a neighborhood.

%
%
\subsubsection{Membership \& Relational Operators}
\label{ch2sETBssSTsssMRO}
If an object is said to be a member of a set, it is written with the symbol $\in$ and expressed as either ``belonging to'', or ``being an element of'', or simply being ``in'' the set. Similarly, a set may be the subset of another set, written with the symbol $\subseteq$, meaning that every member of the first set is also a member of second set. A superset works exactly in reverse, written with the symbol $\supseteq$, it is the identity where every member of the second set is also a member of first set.

In mathematical notation, the membership and relational operators are written as\footnote{The negative operators also exists as $\notin$, $\nsubseteq$, and  $\nsupseteq$}
\begin{align}
	B & \in \left \{A,\,B,\,C\right \} \\
	\left \{A,\,B\right \} & \subseteq \left \{A,\,B,\,C\right \} \\
	\left \{A,\,B,\,C\right \} & \supseteq \left \{A,\,B\right \}
\end{align}

Furthermore, a ``family of sets'' is defined as a multidimensional set, or rather, a set of sets. In general, each member of a family of sets, is a set which shares some common quality with the other members of the family. For example, in Section~\ref{ch2s3ssORN} we will define the set of sets of neighbors as a family of sets, with each member being a set of points comprising a single neighborhood. In this example, it would also be correct to reference to it as simply, a set of neighborhoods.

%
%
\subsubsection{Binary Operations}
\label{ch2sETBssSTsssBO}
Among all the basic binary operations one can perform on a set\footnote{which are the union, intersection, complement, and Cartesian product}, in this thesis, we exclusively use the union operation, denoted as $\cup$, whose output is the set of all objects that are members of either set, or both. For example:
%
\begin{equation}
	\left \{0,\,1,\,2\right \} \cup \left \{2,\,3,\,4\right \} = \left \{0,\,1,\,2,\,3,\,4\right \}
\end{equation}

Also noteworthy, are the commutative and associative properties of the union\todoCitation{associatePropertyOfUnions} operation, which are analogous to the similarly named properties of the addition operator for scalar values. These properties say that the order of the sets, and how the sets are grouped, do not change the final result of the operation\todoCitation{properties of operations, link in notes}, for example:
%Halmos, P. R. (2013-11-27). Naive Set Theory. Springer Science & Business Media. ISBN 9781475716450.
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\big( \left \{0,\,1\right \} \cup \left \{1,\,2\right \} \big) \cup \left \{3,\,4\right \} & = \left \{0,\,1\right \} \cup \big( \left \{3,\,4\right \} \cup \left \{1,\,2\right \}\big) \\
	& = \left \{0,\,1\right \} \cup \left \{1,\,2\right \} \cup \left \{3,\,4\right \} \\
	& = \left \{0,\,1,\,2,\,3,\,4\right \}
	\label{eq:ascAndComPropertiesOfUnions}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The commutative and associative properties of the union operation are exploited in both Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialBuildNeighborhoods} and Algorithm~\ref{alg:parallelBuildNeighborhoods} in order to reduce the complexity of the computations required to ultimately convolve \Fors{t}. In the next section, we will introduce another branch of mathematics which is essential to the research of this thesis; that being linear algebra.

%
%
%
%
\subsection{Linear Algebra}
\label{ch2sETBssLA}
Nearly as fundamental as set theory, linear algebra is the branch of mathematics which studies the different methods and representations which may concern a line, including: sets of equations, matrices, transformations, vector spaces, norming functions, etc. It is used in almost all scientific domains that use mathematics, including geometry and scientific computing, and also provides the symbols and concepts for performing blocks of operations in parallel.~\cite{Weisstein19i} In this section, we will briefly introduce only the major concepts used in our research, position vectors, the subtraction of two vectors, and computing the L2-norm of a vector.

%
%
\subsubsection{Position Vectors}
\label{ch2sETBssLAsssPV}
\todoCitation{position vector}
The concept of position vectors is of paramount importance for nearly all of the calculations which must be performed by the \fors{t}, as the research in this thesis is focused on the efficient convolution of the filter, over a discrete manifold embedded in 3D-space, which is composed of a set of discrete points, each being represented by a set of three Cartesian coordinates; equating points with position vectors.

As in \tdd{}, all position vectors are represented by a set of Cartesian coordinates with cardinality matching that of the dimensionality of the Euclidean space in which it is embedded. For example, in Section~\ref{ch2s3ssP} we say that a point can also be called a position vector, so if we are given a point in $\bR{3}$, it is defined by the three Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, and $z$. ``Cartesian'' refers to the French scholar RenÃ© Descartes~\cite{EB1}, and ``Euclidean'' refers to Euclid of Alexandria, the Ancient Greek mathematician~\cite{EB2}.

Figure~\ref{fig:definePositionVector} provides three examples of why a point may be called a position vector. Any set of coordinates has an implied direction pointing away from the origin, which in $\bR{3}$ is located at $(0, 0, 0)$. In (a) the point $\bp_a$ is in $\bR{1}$ and located at at coordinate $(4)$ which is at a distance of $4$ units away from the origin. In (b) the point $\bp_b$ is in $\bR{2}$ and located at at coordinates $(4,\,4)$ which is at a distance of $4\sqrt{2}$ units away from the origin. In (c) the point $\bp_c$ is in $\bR{3}$ and located at at coordinates $(4,\,4,\,4)$ which is at a distance of $4\sqrt{3}$ units away from the origin\footnote{The lengths in this example increase with each additional dimension: $4 < 4\sqrt{2} \approx 5.657 < 4\sqrt{3} \approx 6.928$}. This concept extends to any Euclidean space $\bR{n}$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\ffigbox
	{\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/definePositionVector.png}}
	{\caption[Examples of Position Vector]{Three examples of position vectors shown as arrows in sand color pointed from the origin in teal color to the points in coral color: (a) $\bp_a$ in $\bR{1}$ at coordinate $(4)$ with length 4, (b) $\bp_b$ in $\bR{2}$ at coordinates $(4,\,4)$ with length $4\sqrt{2}$, (c) $\bp_c$ in $\bR{3}$ at coordinates $(4,\,4,\,4)$ with length $4\sqrt{3}$. The origins are located at $(0)$, $(0,\,0)$, and $(0,\,0,\,0)$ respectively.}\label{fig:definePositionVector}}
\end{figure}

%
%
\subsubsection{Subtracting Two Vectors}
\label{ch2sETBssLAsssS2V}
Among the various binary operators with which one could operate on vectors, this thesis is primarily concerned with subtraction, because it will be used to not only calculate the distance between each pair of adjacent points in the mesh, but also in order to interpolate and extrapolate the function values during the calculations of the \wmfv{s} described in detail in Sections~\ref{ch4sIE}~and~\ref{ch4sWM}.

In order to use the subtraction operator on two vectors in the same Euclidean space, one must simply subtract each component element-wise.~\cite{Weisstein19j} For example, given two points in $\bR{3}$, $A$ and $B$, the difference is calculated as
%
\begin{equation}
	A - B = (A_x - B_x,\,A_y - B_y,\,A_z - B_z)
	\label{eq:vectorSubtraction}
\end{equation}
%
which results in the single set of new coordinates, $\{C_x, C_y, C_z\}$, which both represents the point $C$ located there, or the position vector pointed there from the origin.

%
%
\subsubsection{L2-norm}
\label{ch2sETBssLAsssL2N}
The L2-norm may be seen elsewhere in the literature abbreviated as $L^2$ or $\ell^2$, or perhaps called the ``Euclidean norm'' or ``Euclidean distance''. It is so named because it is the ordinary, straight line distance between two points in Euclidean space, and in the case of a position vector $\bP$ in $\bR{3}$, those two points are the origin at $(0, 0, 0)$ and $\bp$ at the coordinates $\{\bP_x,\,\bP_y,\,\bP_y\}$~\cite{Weisstein19h}.

The purpose for calculating the L2-norm of a vector is to determine the ordinary, uni-dimensional length of the vector, regardless of the dimensionality of Euclidean space in which it is embedded. The significance of this distinction can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:definePositionVector}; despite having all coordinates exclusively set to $4$, the position vector on (a) is of length $4$, in (b) it is of length $4\sqrt{2} \approx 5.657$, and in (c) it is of length $4\sqrt{3} \approx 6.928$.

To determine the length of a vector, one can use the equation for the L2-norm
\begin{equation}
	|\bp| \enspace=\enspace \|\bp\|_2 \enspace=\enspace \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + \ldots + n^2} \enspace:\enspace \bp \in \bR{n}
	\label{eq:l2norm}
\end{equation}

In this thesis, the L2-norm is denoted using the abbreviated symbols $|\bp|$. Please note the similar notation for the cardinality of a set $|\bP|$. While the matching symbols do represent somewhat similar concepts, cardinality is the count of elements in the set, but the L2-norm of a vector is calculated as in Equation~\ref{eq:l2norm}.~\cite[p.~26]{Mara12}

\subsection{Geometry}
\label{ch2sETBssG}
As vast and encompassing is geometry as a field of study, in this section, we will only introduce the few concepts which are of paramount importance for \fors{t}, including: geodesic discs for ensuring a consistent filter widow size for the duration of each convolution in Section~\ref{ch4sSEL}, the characteristics of a circle sector to be used in calculating the area and center of gravity in Section~\ref{ch4sACG}, as well as interpolation and extrapolation for calculating the \wmfv{s} in Section~\ref{ch4sWM}.
\todoResearch{weighted averaging using density}
\todoResearch{static filter window size importance}

%
%
\subsubsection{Geodesic Discs}
\label{ch2sETBssGsssGD}
Geodesy, the term from which geodesic discs get their name, is defined differently in many fields.\todoCitation{geodesy} A geodesic, defined in the original sense, was the shortest route between two points on the Earth's surface; so a straight line distance in curved space. In this thesis, we use the term geodesic disc to mean the surface area on a manifold, encompassed by a circle with a given radius, which itself is also embedded in $\bR{3}$, and reference to such a disc with the symbol $\bO$.
\todoResearch{create figure of geodeisc disc in 3d}

The significance being the similar mathematical treatment of all adjacent faces in any given neighborhood, in order to ensure a consistent filter window size for the duration of each convolution of \fors{t}, despite that given the nature of acquired \tdd{} as discussed in Section~\ref{ch2s3ssAVS3}, which likely all exist on different planes in $\bR{3}$. Also, from the geodesic disc, we derive the circle sectors which are described in detail in the next section.
\todoResearch{static filter window size importance}
\nomenclature[aa]{$\bO$}{a geodesic disc}%
\nomenclature[ab]{$\bO_v$}{a specific geodesic disc centered about the point $\bp_v$}%

%
%
\subsubsection{Circle Sectors}
\label{ch2sETBssGsssCS}
A circular sector, or circle sector, is the portion of a disc enclosed by two radii and an arc. In general, the larger area is known as the major sector, however \fors{t} is only concerned with the area of the other, smaller area, known as the minor sector as it is a natural way to partition a geodesic disc embedded in $\bR{3}$, where each sector can be delineated by the border of two triangular faces which likely exists on different planes.\todoReference{figure of geodesic disc in 3d, once made} Going forward, the minor circle sector will be abbreviated as just ``the circle sector'', or even more simply, ``the sector'', and will be denoted as $\bs$, or $\bs_i$ in reference to a specific circle sector, as described in Section~\ref{ch4sSEL}.%
\nomenclature[ba]{``the sector''}{or the circle sector; the minor sector of a circle defined by its radius and central angle}%
\nomenclature[bb]{$\bs$}{a circle sector}%
\nomenclature[bc]{$\bs_i$}{a specific circle sector}%

As the sector can be described entirely by the central angle $\alpha$ and the circle's radius\footnote{$\ell_{a,b}$ was chosen to represent the radius instead of the much more common $r$, because in \tdd{}, edges are not stored, yet distances between points can be calculated as shown in Section~\ref{ch2s3ssEL}} $\ell_{a,b}$, the area of the sector can be given as
%
\begin{equation}
	A = \pi \ell_{a,b}^2\frac{\alpha}{2\pi} = \frac{\ell_{a,b}^2\alpha}{2}
	\label{eq:areaOfCircleSector}
\end{equation}
%
because of the fact that in radians, the ratio of a sector's central angle $\alpha$ to the complete angle of the circle $2\pi$, is equal to the ratio of that sector's area to area of the whole circle.~\cite{Weisstein19d}%
\nomenclature[bd]{$A$}{an area of a circular sector}%

%
%
\subsubsection{Center of Gravity}
\label{ch2sEBTssGsssCG}
Along with area, the other important characteristic of a circle sector for \fors{t} is the centroid, or center of gravity, which is used in both Algorithms~\ref{alg:serialConvolveFilter}~and~\ref{alg:parallelConvolveFilter} in order to calculate the \wmfv{s}, by serving as the location to which the function values are interpolated, the operation which is discussed in the next section.

The center of gravity is named so, because it is the point where the sector would balance on a pin\footnote{given that it had been bestowed a volume with uniform density}. The center of gravity $\bc$ is calculated as the distance from the center point $\bp_a$, along the line which bisects the central angle $\alpha$, and is given by
%
\begin{equation}
	\check{\ell} := \frac{4\:\gelm\:\sin(\frac{\alpha_i}{2})}{3\,\alpha_i}
	\label{eq:ch2distToCoG}
\end{equation}%%
\nomenclature[ca]{$\bc$}{the center of gravity of circle sector $\bs_i$}%
\nomenclature[cb]{$\check{\ell}$}{the distance from $\bp_0$ to $\bc$}%

In the Figure~\ref{fig:circleSector}, a circle sector is produced by the points $\bp_a$, $\bp_b$, and $\bp_c$, has the central angle $\alpha$, which is bisected by a dotted line, and $\ell_{a,b}$ representing the length between points $\bp_a$ and $\bp_b$, which is equal radius of the circle. Also shown, is the center of gravity $\bc$, as well as $\check{\ell}$, the distance to $\bc$ from the center point $\bp_a$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\ffigbox
	{\includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/circleSector.png}}
	{\caption[A Circle Sector in Detail]{The circle sector produced by points $\bp_a$, $\bp_b$, and $\bp_c$, with $\alpha$ as the central angle bisected by a dotted line, and $\ell_{a,b}$ as the length between points $\bp_a$ and $\bp_b$ which is equal radius of the circle. Also labeled is the center of gravity $\bc$ as well as the distance from the center point $\bp_a$ to $\bc$, drawn in a coral color as $\check{\ell}$}\label{fig:circleSector}}
\end{figure}

The line which bisects the central angle of a circle sector, while not used explicitly in calculations, is an important concept for much of the computations used by \fors{t}, as will be seen in Chapter~\ref{ch4}. Therefore, we make a special note here that the abbreviated, ``bisecting line'', indeed refers to this line which splits the circle sector, and its central angle $\alpha$, into two equivalent halves.%
\nomenclature[cc]{``bisecting line''}{the line which bisects the central angle of a circle sector}%

%
%
\subsubsection{Interpolation \& Extrapolation}
\label{ch2sETBssGsssIE}
Simply stated, interpolation is a method of constructing new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points, such as those points found in the discrete manifolds of in \tdd{}. There exist a large variety of methods for interpolating different kinds of data\todoCitation{different kinds of interpolation}, but in this thesis, we will only consider linear interpolation, which is simple to calculate\footnote{however can become imprecise in relation to the square of the distance between the data points.}\todoCitation{footnote:error of linear interpolation} and can be extended for n-dimensions\todoCitation{n-dimensional linear interpolation}.

Given the two data points in $\bR{2}$, $(x_a, y_a)$ and $(x_b, y_b)$, the $y_c$ coordinate of a third point located along a straight line drawn between the first two points, while also having the coordinate $x_c$, can be calculated as
%
\begin{equation}
	y_c = y_a + (y_b - y_a) \frac{x_c - x_a}{x_b - x_a}
	\label{eq:interpolationGeneral}
\end{equation}

To elaborate the concept of interpolation, now consider the two points $(1, 2)$ and $(5, 1)$, then find the $y$ coordinate of a point between them, located at the intersection of the line which contains the first two points and $x = 3$
%
\begin{align}
	y_c & = 2 + (1 - 2) \frac{3 - 1}{5 - 1} \\
	& = 2 + -1 \frac{2}{4} \enspace = \enspace  1.5
	\label{eq:interpolationSpecific}
\end{align}
%
We therefore interpolate the value halfway between the two given points to be $(3,\,1.5)$, which is halfway between as expected, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:interpolation}.

Conversely, extrapolation is a method for constructing new data points \textit{outside} the range of a discrete set of known data points. The process of linear extrapolation is equivalent\footnote{The difference between interpolation and extrapolation is largely an academic one, owing primarily to the lack of boundaries and increasing error rates associated with extrapolation.} to linear interpolation; namely, first calculating the line between two points, then the $y$ coordinate of a third point at a new value of $x$, either greater than or less than both of the first two points.

As illustrated by Figure~\ref{fig:interpolation}, the similarities and differences between the processes of interpolation and extrapolation, become even more intuitive when seen graphically, where having chosen the two points $\bp_a$ and $\bp_b$, a third point $\bp_c$ is interpolated between the two points, while the fourth point $\bp_d$ is extrapolated outside their domain.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\ffigbox
	{\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{figures/interpolation.png}}
	{\caption[Interpolation between two points in $\bR{2}$]{$\bp_c$ is interpolated as a value between $\bp_a$ and $\bp_b$}\label{fig:interpolation}}
\end{figure}

Later in this thesis, we will use both interpolation and extrapolation together, in order to calculate the \wmfv{s} at the center of gravity of circle sectors, so that the function values may be weighted fairly in regards to their distance to the other points in the one-ring neighborhood, as discussed in detail in Section~\ref{ch4sIE}.

%
%
%
%
\subsection{Topology}
\label{ch2sETBssT}
Topology is the mathematical study of the properties of space that are preserved through deformations, twistings, and stretchings of objects\footnote{but not tearing or gluing}, which developed as a field of study from geometry and set theory through analysis of concepts such as space, dimension, and transformation. For example, a circle is topologically equivalent to an ellipse, because it can be deformed by stretching.~\cite{Weisstein19c}

Of all the major concepts studied in topology, this thesis is only concerned manifolds, as \tdd{} is composed primarily of two-dimensional discrete manifolds embedded in three-dimensional space, as well as neighborhoods, the general concept from which one-ring neighborhoods are derived, thus the basis upon which \fors{t} is founded.

%
%
\subsubsection{Manifolds}
\label{ch2sETBssTsssM}
A manifold is a topological space that is locally, but possibly not globally, Euclidean; a concept that is central to many parts of geometry because it allows complicated structures, such as the triangle mesh, to be described and understood in terms of the simpler, local topological properties. Said another way, this means that a manifold is an $n$D-subset of an Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{>n}$.~\cite[p.~199]{Mara12} For example, 1-dimensional manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ include lines and circles, and 2-dimensional manifolds in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, also called surfaces, can include commonly-known shapes such as the plane, the sphere, and the torus, but also of prime importance for this thesis, the triangle mesh.

The significance to our research, is that each convolution of \Fors{t} is comprised of calculations of the \wmfv{s} at the central point of a one-ring neighborhood, having weighted the function values in relation to the distance between each neighbor, and because those distances are uniformly dissimilar in acquired \tdd{}\todoCitation{tdd{} is not regular}, maintaining a consistent filter window size is only accomplished by defining the geodesic disc, which exists on the manifold defined by the mesh. Therefore, as discussed in more detail in Chapter~\ref{ch4}, the weights may be calculated sector-wise, as if all sectors were on the same plane, greatly reducing the complexity of the entire procedure.

%
%
\subsubsection{Neighborhoods}
\label{ch2sETBssTsssN}
A neighborhood is also one of the basic concepts of topology. Intuitively speaking, a neighborhood of a point is a set of points containing that point, where one can move in any direction without leaving the set. While determining the neighborhood is trivial for uni-dimensional manifolds\footnote{where each neighborhood only consists of a point, and the two points to either side of it on the line}, and relatively simple for regular two-dimensional manifolds\footnote{such as with a 2D-image, whose pixels have at most four neighbors in orthogonal directions with a geometric distance of 1, as well as four neighbors at the diagonal directions with a geometric distance of $\sqrt{2}$}, determining the neighborhood becomes more complicated for irregular surfaces like those found in \tdd{}. With those surfaces, one must determine the set of neighbors using the associations that define the triangular faces; the details of which are covered in detail in Section:~\ref{ch2s3ssORN}, after the necessary topics regarding \tdd{} have already been discussed.

Figure~\ref{fig:neighborhoods} illustrates the differences among one-ring neighborhoods in different kinds of manifolds: (a) a regular square mesh as with pixels of a digital image, (b) a regular triangle mesh, as in a hexagonal tessellation, then in (c) the figure shows two very different neighborhoods in a single, irregular triangle mesh typical of acquired \tdd{}. In particular, notice in (c) the completely arbitrary shape and size of the one-ring neighborhoods found in the irregular triangle mesh; even the number of neighbors varies widely. From this observation is where much of the motivation behind \fors{t} came.

\section{\tdd}
\label{ch2s3}
The data upon which one convolves \fors{t} is called \tdd\todoCitation{\tdd{} name origin, BB82 from Mara12}. As described in Section~\ref{ch2s3ssM}, \tdd{} consists primarily of a single mesh $\bM$, which is composed of $\bP$, a set of points, and the set $\bT$, consisting of triangular faces, each to be covered in Sections~\ref{ch2s3ssP} and~\ref{ch2s3ssF} respectively. \tdd{} also comes in two distinct flavors depending on its origin: acquired or synthetic, as discussed in Section~\ref{ch2s3ssAVS3}. The data can also include a texture map and other various types of information stored as scalar or vector fields, as elaborated on in~\ref{ch2s3ssFV}.

%
%
%
%
\subsection{Points}
\label{ch2s3ssP}
A point $\bp$ is the most primitive element of \tdd{}. ``Point'' is the abbreviated form of ``measuring point'', and is also known in other fields of study as a vertex, or a position vector $\bR{3}$\todoCitation{other names for a point}. A point is defined by the 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, and $z$, and in \tdd{}, points are generally unique and not required to be in any particular order. In this thesis, a point is addressed using several different subscripts, depending on the context.

In this thesis, when referring to a point in $\bP$, $v$ is used as the globally unique index; the index with which we can define the set
%
\begin{equation}
	\bP := \left \{\:\bp_v \mid v \in \mathbb{N}, \;\text{and}\; 1\leq v \leq v_{max}\:\right \}
	\label{eq:defineSetOfPoints}

\subsection{Faces}
\label{ch2s3ssF}
Faces are the another primitive element of \tdd{}. As we are working exclusively with triangular meshes~\cite[p.~26]{Mara12}, we define a face $\bt$ by the set of three distinct points, which we will index in clockwise order\footnote{It is worth mentioning here that many software packages, such as the GigaMesh Framework~\cite[p.~89]{Mara12}, may expect counter-clockwise ordering of indexes. This is significant because the ordering provides an orientation by which visualization software can apply texture and/or lighting. The only mathematical significance of the ordering is the sign of the area of a face, and totally inconsequential when the absolute value is expected, as shown by~\cite[p.~2]{Braden86}. This is yet another example of the difference between the conventions of mathematical literature versus those of computer science. And again, because this thesis should indeed be considered mathematical literature, we will continue to follow the conventions of mathematical literature.}~\cite[p.~4]{Mara17}.
\todoResearch{does the "right-hand-rule apply here?"}
%
\begin{equation}
	\bt := \left \{\,\bp_a,\,\bp_b,\,\bp_c\right \} = \left \{\,\bp_1,\,\bp_2,\,\bp_3\right \}
	\label{eq:defineFaces}
\end{equation}

With the introduction of faces comes the concept of adjacency. A face $\bt_i$ is said to be adjacent to another face $\bt_j$ if, and only if, they share together the same subset of two points. Similarly, a point $\bp_a$ is said to be adjacent to another point $\bp_b$ if, and only if, the set $\{\bp_a, \bp_b\}$ is a subset of at least one face $\bt \in \bT$. A synonym for adjacent is ``neighboring'', and this thesis will use both interchangeably. \todoReword{add equation for these identities}\todoReword{index entry for adjacent}

Figure~\ref{fig:triangularFaces} shows two adjacent triangular faces $\bt_1$ and $\bt_2$, and the relationship between their points $\bp_a$, $\bp_b$, and $\bp_c$, their edge lengths $\ell_a$, $\ell_b$, and $\ell_c$, and their clockwise orientation. Because the concept illustrated in this figure is fundamental to understanding the structure of all \tdd{}, therefore also \Fors{t}, and yet may not be immediately intuitive without proper context, we reference this figure several times throughout the rest of this thesis.

\end{figure}

Each distinct triangular face is addressed using the global index $k$, and when taken together, comprise the set
%
\begin{equation}
	\bT := \left \{\:\bt_k \mid k \in \mathbb{N}, \;\text{and}\; 1\leq k \leq k_{max}\:\right \}
	\label{eq:defineSetOfFaces}
\end{equation}
%
where $k_{max}$ is the maximum index of faces in the data, and is equivalent to the cardinality of the set of faces $|\bT|$.%
\nomenclature[fa]{$\bT$}{the set of faces $\bt$ in $\bM$}%
\nomenclature[fb]{$\bt_k$}{a specific face in $\bT$}%

%
%
%
%
\subsection{Edge Lengths}
\label{ch2s3ssEL}
As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:triangularFaces}, each triangular face is implicitly composed of three edges. Despite the fact that an edge is not typically\footnote{Other data structures, such as the Winged-Edge~\cite[p.~1]{Baumgart75}, may use edges as a primitive element} a primitive element of \tdd{}, we will endeavor to define the length of an edge $\ell$, because edge lengths are of particular significance for both the design and implementation of \fors{t}.

What is also particularly interesting about Figure~\ref{fig:triangularFaces}, is that when edge lengths are defined by the points of specific faces, each non-border edge length, illustrated in the figure as $\ell_a$ in $\bt_1$, and $\ell_c$ in $\bt_2$, will be labeled twice, despite representing the same distance.

When in the context of a particular face $\bt_k$, we will use a single index to define the length
%
\begin{equation}
	\ell_a := |\bp_b - \bp_c| \enspace:\enspace \left \{\,\bp_a,\,\bp_b,\,\bp_c\right \} = \bt_k
	\label{eq:defineEdgeLengthFace}
\end{equation}%
\nomenclature[ga]{$\ell_i$}{the length of the edge opposite the point $\bp_i$ of a specific face}%
%
and double indices when an edge length is referenced in relation to a specific point $\bp_v$ and its neighbor $\bp_i$
%
\begin{equation}
	\ell_{\sv{i}} := |\bp_i - \bp_v|
	\label{eq:defineEdgeLengthPoint}
\end{equation}%
\nomenclature[gb]{$\ell_{\sv{i}}$}{the length of the edge between points $\bp_v$ and $\bp_i$}%

Please note the similar notation for the cardinality of a set $|\bP|$, to that for the calculation for the length of the edge $|\bp_i - \bp_v|$ as defined in Equation~\ref{eq:defineEdgeLengthPoint}. While cardinality is simply the count of elements in the set, the length is calculated as the L2-norm of the referenced vector.~\cite[p.~26]{Mara12}

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	|\bp_i - \bp_v| & = \lVert\bp_i - \bp_v\rVert_2 \\
					& = \sqrt{(x_i-x_v)^2 + (y_i-y_v)^2 + (y_i-y_v)^2}
	\label{eq:defineEdgeLengthCalc}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Meshes}
\label{ch2s3ssM}
In \tdd{}, a mesh $\bM$ is the digital representation of a discrete manifold embedded in $\bR{3}$, and is typically\footnote{except in the case of specifically designed synthetic data~\ref{ch7sSD}} two-dimensional, non-planar and comprised of non-regular, triangular faces composed of connected points.~\cite[p.~25]{Mara12} A mesh is the set defined as
%
\begin{equation}
	\bM := \left \{\bP,\:\bT\right \}
	\label{eq:defineMesh}
\end{equation}%
\nomenclature[da]{$\bM$}{a mesh; the set including the sets of all points $\bp$ and faces $\bt$}%
%
with the set $\bP$ consisting of points, and the set $\bT$ consisting of triangular faces.

Many 3D-scanners produce point clouds\todoCitation{3D-scanners produce point clouds}, which as the name suggests, are comprised soley of a set of points $\bP$ and do not provide the set $\bT$. However, it is possible, and necessary for the production of a mesh, to perform a point set triangulation\todoCitation{perform a point set triangulation} in order to connect $\bP$ into a set of triangle faces, enabling one to combine the two sets into a mesh.~\cite[p.~26]{Mara12} For example, during our experiments, we perform the well-known Delaunay triangulation\todoCitation{Delaunay triangulation} in order to produce a mesh from a randomly generated point cloud\todoReference{experiments}.

\subsection{One-Ring Neighborhoods}
\label{ch2s3ssORN}
It was mentioned in Section~\ref{ch2sETBssTsssN}, that it is a non-trivial task to determine the neighborhood of a point $\bp_v$, which exists in an irregular triangle mesh embedded in three-dimensions. Having now examined the definitions of points, faces, and meshes, we can now formalize the one-ring neighborhood in \tdd{} as
%
\begin{equation}
	\bN_v := \left \{\;\bp_i\;:\;\left \{\,\bp_i,\,\bp_v\right \} \subseteq \bt \quad \forall \bt \in \bT\;\right \}
	\label{eq:defineNeighborhood}
\end{equation}%
\nomenclature[ha]{$\bN_v$}{the set of points comprising the one-ring neighborhood about $\bP_v$}%
\nomenclature[hb]{$\bp_i$}{a one-ring neighbor of $\bp_v$}%
%
which in words, means that the neighborhood $\bN_v$ is defined as the set of points $\bp_i$ such that both $\bp_i$ and $\bp_v$ are two points of a triangular face $\bt$, for all faces in the mesh. Therefore, the adjacency of points is defined by the co-membership within a face $\bt$, from the set of faces $\bT$.

When taken together, all the neighborhoods $\bN_v$ comprise a set of sets of neighbors; the family of sets
%
\begin{equation}
	\bN := \left \{\bN_v,\,\bN_{v+1},\ldots,\,\bN_{v_max}\right \}
	\label{eq:defineNeighborhood}
\end{equation}%
\nomenclature[hc]{$\bN$}{a family of sets of neighbors, the set of neighborhoods}%
This definition shares the indices $v$ and $v_{max}$ with the definition for a set of points, Equation~\ref{eq:defineSetOfPoints}, to highlight the fact that neighborhoods are defined per point, therefore there must be a correlation in the cardinality between the two sets.

Conversely, the cardinality of each individual neighborhood $|\bN_v|$ will likely vary among other neighborhoods in $\bN$, however, the value must always be $\geq 2$, and though there is no upper limit, $|\bN_v|$ is typically $\leq 12$. Furthermore, the neighboring points are always indexed in a clockwise direction for the same reasons as discussed in Section~\ref{ch2s3ssF}.
\todoResearch{get real upper limit for n}.%

As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:neighborhoods}, the set of black points are the neighbors $\bp_i$ which belong to $\bN_v$, what is known as a one-ring neighborhood\footnotemark of $\bp_v$, because they are directly connected with the center point $\bp_v$ drawn in coral color. The moniker originates from graph theory where each adjacent point is said to have a relative distance of 1 within the graph of the mesh. \footnotetext{The one-ring can be extended to a 2-ring by taking the union of the neighborhood $\bN_v$ with the neighborhood of each one-ring neighbor $\bp_i$, which adds to the neighborhood, points with the relative distance of 2 within the graph. This iterative concept can be repeated k times and the neighborhood is than referred to as k-ring. Unfortunately, regardless of the fact that the relative distance within the graph can not be assumed equal to the geometric distance nor geodesic distance, it is still used throughout the literature â€“ especially in the field of Computer Graphics.~\cite[p.~29]{Mara12}}
\todoBackground{add a subsection on graph theory in basic theory section}

Our solution for maintaining a constant filter window size while convolving \fors{t} over neighborhoods of varying shapes and sizes is to determine the global minimum edge length, then use that as the radius of the geodesic disc centered at the central point of a neighborhood, in order calculate the \wmfv{s} of each circle sector, after interpolating each value function value from the neighboring points to the center of gravity, as explained in greater detail in Chapter~\ref{ch4}, later in this thesis.

\subsection{Acquired vs Synthetic \tdd{}}
\label{ch2s3ssAVS3}
The corpus of all \tdd{} exists in two flavors, acquired and synthetic data, with each being handily classifiable by the fashion in which it was generated, and the characteristics innate to those techniques.\todoReword{consider adding a figure here showing difference, or referencing a figure or pair of figures that does}

Acquired \tdd{} is typically captured as a point cloud utilizing various methods, such as: LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), Structured Light, or Structure from Motion~\cite[p.~19]{Mara12}. Then the data is exported from software packages accompanying the 3D-scanners as either just the point cloud as a simple set of points $\bP$, or optionally as a triangle mesh $\bM$, described by one or more scalar-fields. Acquired \tdd{} also often consists upwards of a million points and as many as twice that number of faces\todoReference{the interesting experimental finding about face to vertex ratio; add as a footnote}. These exported meshes ~\cite[p.~25]{Mara12} uniformly contain noise and may exhibit other complexities for analysis, such as: non-manifold points, multiple borders and holes in the surface, inverted face orientation, non-manifold edges, and agglutination or degenerate faces. ~\cite[p.~28-32]{Mara12}

Conversely, synthetic \tdd{} is artfully crafted to avoid the complexities exhibited by acquired data. When modeling 3-dimensional objects, synthetic \tdd{} can require significantly less memory for storage, as simplifications can be made for large regular surfaces. For example, even the largest flat, rectangular surface can be modeled with only four points and two faces, whereas the acquired data methods require that the Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem\todoCitation{Nyquist Shannon Theorem} be obeyed for the smallest detectable feature throughout the entire surface.~\cite[p.~19]{Mara12}~\cite[p.~3]{Mara17}

For our experiments\todoReference{experiments}, we created another kind of synthetic \tdd{} which does not model a 3D-object. Instead, these synthetic-mesh generators produce different types of tessellations on arbitrarily large, planar surfaces, accompanied by a configurable scalar-field of function values.

%
%
%
\subsection{Function Values}
\label{ch2s3ssFV}
In addition to the three Cartesian coordinates, point which comprise a mesh may also contain other relevant data in the form of scalar fields, or vector fields, when combined together into multi-dimensional data. This information, which is stored at each point $\bp$, often includes data regarding: RGB color, material type, reflectivity, transparency, quality, confidence, or the resulting function values from an analytical filter such as the Multi-Scale Integral Invariants (MSII) filter~\cite[p.~21]{Mara12}, but can be extended to include data important to other fields of study, such as: infrared or ultraviolet light, temperature, rainfall, population, crime-rates, etc; essentially, any kind of data that may be measured at a point. As \fors{t} will currently\todoReference{future work/applications} only process a single field at a time, we can define a scalar field simply as the set of function values
%
\begin{equation}
	\bF := \left \{\: f_v \mid v \in \mathbb{N}, \;\text{and}\; 1\leq v \leq v_{max} \:\right \}
	\label{eq:defineSetOfFunctionValues}
\end{equation}%
\nomenclature[ia]{$\bF$}{the set of function values $f$; a scalar field}%
\nomenclature[ib]{$f_v$}{a specific function value in $\bF$, corresponding to $\bp_v$}%
%
This definition shares the indices $v$ and $v_{max}$ with, Equation~\ref{eq:defineSetOfPoints}, the definition for a set of points, because indeed, it is a fact that the cardinality of $|\bF|$ must be equal to $|\bP|$
%
\begin{equation}
	|\bF| \mbeq |\bP|
\end{equation}
%
because function values are only stored alongside the Cartesian coordinates, 1-for-1 with points, due to \tdd{} existing as a discrete manifold. The significance of which is another motivating factor behind the research conducted in this thesis.

%Anti Dependence	S1 ->A S2	An anti-dependence between S1 and S2 means that S1 reads from a location later written to by S2.

%Input Dependence	S1 ->I S2	An input dependence between S1 and S2 means that S1 and S2 read from the same location.
The concepts of control and data dependencies are not new ones, and can be dated back to the invention of multi-pass compilers\todoCitation{Data Dependencies and multi-pass compilers}. The field of study regarding the details is called dependence analysis and has far-reaching consequences from business management, economics, as well as software optimization\todoCitation{dependence analysis}. In general, the basic concept behind both control and data dependencies is that some procedure A is said to be dependent on another procedure B, if A requires B to be executed first.

Figure~\ref{fig:simpleControlDependency} shows the ubiquitous if-then control structure as a simple example of a control dependency. It reads, ``if B is true, then do A''. In this case A is control dependent on B, because B must execute before it can be determined wether or not to execute A.

	{\caption[If-Then Control Dependency]{A simple example of control dependency using the if-then control structure, with each distinct operation colored in teal, and control dependency marked with an arrow.}\label{fig:simpleControlDependency}}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:dataDependencyOfL2Norm} illustrates the less-than-simple example of data dependencies inherent to calculating the L2-norm of a position vector in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, which has already been seen in Equation~\ref{eq:l2norm}, and will be seen often in this thesis. There are six individual procedures involved with calculating the L2-norm: three squarings, two additions, and one square root. The three squaring procedures are totally independent of each other and can be performed in any order, indeed even concurrently, in relation to one another. In contrast, the two additions are totally dependent on their addends. While the order in which the first two of the three addends are used is inconsequential, the first addition is always dependent on the completion of two squarings, and the second addition is dependent on not only the sum from the first addition, but the product of the third squaring as well. Finally, because the square root procedure is dependent on the execution of both additions, it also inherits their dependencies on the squaring procedures, and therefore must wait until the very end before executing last.\todoResearch{name of this inheritance, associative?}

\subsection{Serial Computation \& Threads}
In a very general sense, when a computer executes a serial program, it proceeds one instruction at a time, sequentially in the order that it is written, reading and writing to memory as required. Individually, these are called threads of execution, and a single processing core can only process a single such thread at a time, however, it can rapidly perform context switching\todoCitation{context switching} among a multitude of self-contained threads, each with their own unique ids and memory addresses, in order to give the illusion of parallel processing.

As memory to be processed by a thread is stored somewhere in a hierarchy which increases in size, but decreases in speed as one moves from the processor's registers, it is likely that a context switch will cause what is known as a cache miss\todoCitation{cache hit or miss, check Lang}, which incurs a time penalty while the processing stalls and the required memory is read from slower hardware sources.
