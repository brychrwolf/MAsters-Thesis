\chapter{Fast One-Ring Smoothing: Serial Algorithms}
\label{ch4}
In the previous chapter we presented the mathematical grounding for an improved version of \Fors{t}, as it is currently implemented within the GigaMesh framework. Now in this chapter, we will use mathematical pseudo-code to combine all of the equations from Chapter~\ref{ch3}, Equations~\ref{eq:localMinimumEdgeLength} through~\ref{eq:meanFuncValAtPv}, into a serial algorithm, with the goal of preparing the basis from which we will subsequently design the parallel algorithm presented in Chapter~\ref{ch6}.

\section{An Algorithm in Three Parts}
\label{ch4sATP}
The serial algorithm defined in this chapter requires that the membership of all one-ring neighborhoods must first be discovered, before one is ever able to begin convolving the filter, because the total efficiency of the algorithm relies on iterating over the family of sets of neighborhoods $\bN$, as will be made clear in Sections~\ref{ch4sCEL}, and~\ref{ch4sCF}, while the underlying data structure of \tdd{} typically only stores a mesh $\bM$ as the family of sets comprised of the two sets $\bP$ of points, and $\bT$ of triangular faces, remaining completely ignorant of the \gls{adjacency} between faces or even the concept of neighborhoods.

Also critical to the total efficiency of the filter, is the pre-calculation of the edge lengths between all pairs of adjacent points, whose magnitudes never change regardless of the number of convolutions being applied. This importance stems from the way all edge lengths are used in computation during the loop for convolving the filter, which we will refer to as ``\gls{tPrinLoop}'' going forward, at least five times per convolution, and ten times per convolution for the majority of points, which are non-border pairs whose relationships are duplicated in \gls{adjacent} neighborhoods.

Therefore, in order to maximize the efficiency of \fors{t}, it is crucial to split the algorithm into three distinct parts: first building neighborhoods, then calculating edge lengths, and finally convolving the filter, all of this while simultaneously storing the results of the first two parts so that they may be used during the iterative convolutions of the third part; the result being a massive increase in efficiency by greatly reducing the number of operations-per-convolution required by the filter.

\section{Building Neighborhoods}
\label{ch4sBN}
Before convolving \fors{t}, one must initially discover all the points in the mesh $\bp_i$ which comprise each neighborhood $\bN_v$, then store those connections in the family of sets $\bN$. That is the purpose of Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialBuildNeighborhoods}. Despite the fact that building $\bN$ outside of the principle loop adds an additional $6\cdot|\bT|$ operations to the total, Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialCalculateEdgeLengths} becomes able to exploit the explicit connections stored in $\bN$, in order to vastly reduce its complexity from $|\bP|^{|\bT|}$ down to only $|\bP|^{\bar{n}}$, where $\bar{n}$ is the average size of all neighborhoods, which with acquired \tdd{}, will typically evaluate to approximately 6.\todoReference{average neighborhood size estimate} Also, as we will see in Section~\ref{ch4sCF}, when $\tau$ is the user-defined number of convolutions to perform, the complexity of the principle loop can be meaningfully reduced to only $\tau^{|\bP|^{2\cdot\bar{n}}}$, down from the $\tau^{|\bP|^{(2\cdot|\bT|)}}$ that would have been necessary, had the neighborhoods not already been discovered and the procedure been otherwise required to discover the members of $\bN_v$ in each convolution.%

Figure~\ref{fig:unionsOfSimpleBuildNeighborhoods} describes a very simple mesh consisting of just two faces and four points, similar to that which is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:triangularFaces}. The arrows represent the union operation between a point and a neighborhood, and are colored to match the face from whence the point had come. It should be noted that the two pairs of arrows pointing from $\bp_2$ to $\bN_3$, and $\bp_3$ to $\bN_2$, indicate that both of these union operations occur twice, one originating from each faces, but because of the uniqueness property of sets, the duplicated operations are wholly inconsequential to the the final membership of either neighborhood.

	{\caption[Union Operations as Performed in Build Neighborhoods]{A very simple mesh consisting of just two faces and four points, similar to that which is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:triangularFaces}.

The arrows represent the union operation between a point and a neighborhood are colored to match the face from whence the point had come. The two pairs of arrows, pointing from $\bp_2$ to $\bN_3$ and $\bp_3$ to $\bN_2$, are teal colored to highlight the fact that these union operations occur twice.
}\label{fig:unionsOfSimpleBuildNeighborhoods}}
\end{figure}

Also notice in Figure~\ref{fig:unionsOfSimpleBuildNeighborhoods}, that the union operation is performed exactly twice per point per face, which is once each between the neighborhood of the center point and a neighboring point, for a total of six times per face. For example, the triangular face $\bt_2$ contains the point $\bp_4$, therefore the union operation is performed on $\bN_4$ at least two times, once for each of the other members of point $\bt_2$, $\bp_2$, and $\bp_3$. This realization will influence the design of the parallel variant of the algorithm, as described in Section~\ref{ch5sBNPssASABN}.

In Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialBuildNeighborhoods}, the function \textit{serialBuildNeighborhoods} describes iterating over every triangular face $\bt$ in $\bT$. Then for each face's three corner points, the union operation is perfomed between the neighborhood centered at the point, and the other two points which are adjacent to the central point. After processing every face, the result becomes a fully-populated family of sets $\bN$, storing the connections between every neighbor of every neighborhood in the mesh $\bM$.

The function \textit{union} is defined separately in Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialBuildNeighborhoods} for two reasons. The first reason is that when separated, it becomes very clear that the union operation behaves similarly for all three permutations\footnote{In general, a set of three numbers has six permutations, however, here only the first index is important, and the order of the second two parameters are arbitrary due to the commutative property of the union operation, as shown in Equation~\ref{eq:ascAndComPropertiesOfUnions}, resulting in only 3 distinct possibilities.} of corners, and indeed, it is only the order of the indices which changes. The second reason is that this signature will match more closely that of its parallel variant, to be defined in Algorithm~\ref{alg:parallelBuildNeighborhoods}, which will require the union operation to remain separate.

\section{Calculating Edge Lengths}
\label{ch4sCEL}
Having now built in the previous section the family of sets of neighborhoods $\bN$, we can advance to the next step, Algorithm~\ref{alg:parallelCalculateEdgeLengths}, which iterates over each pair of neighbors comprising $\bN$, with the goal of building a set of pre-calculated edge lengths $\bE$, as well as determining the global minimum edge length $\gelm$; both being essential parameters of Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialConvolveFilter}.

As shown in Equation~\ref{eq:defineEdgeLengthPoint}, the calculation of an edge's length requires taking the L2-norm of the difference between two points, which itself involves using the square root operation. In modern software, the square root operation is performed by computing ``Newton's Iteration'', or ``Newton's method''\todoCitation{software uses Newton's iteration for sqrt}, which is essentially multiple iterations of the so-called, ``recurrence equation''~\cite{Weisstein19b}\todoCitation{Newton's iteration uses recurrence equation}. The impact for \Fors{t} is that the computation of a square root typically\todoCitation{how slow is Newton's iteration compared to others} takes many more compute cycles than any other binary or unary operation, thus taking more time to complete overall. In fact, because of the slowness of the square root operation, computing the L2-norm in order to calculate an edge's length is empirically the most costly operation performed by the filter. Therefore, it is imperative that we pay special attention to avoid unnecessary instructions to calculate an edge's length. For that reason, we define the symbol $\ellstar$ to represent the calculation of an edge's length using ``Newton's Iteration'', so that we can draw focus to its importance while remaining concise.%

%\todoReword{add footnote with desc and citation about slowness of sqrt}
%\todoResearch{qualify, do experiment to prove how slow sqrt is, maybe make appendix entry about what it is and why it is so slow}

In Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialCalculateEdgeLengths}, the function \textit{serialCalculateEdgeLengths} iterates over a set of nested loops which considers each neighbor $\bp_i$ of each neighborhood $\bN_v$, in order to calculate the edge lengths between the center point $\bp_v$ and its neighboring points $\bp_i$. The result is then stored in the set $\bE$ using the pair of indices $v, i$ to reflect the structure of the family of sets of neighborhoods $\bN$. Finally, in each iteration, the value of the global minimum edge length $\gelm$ is updated to become the minimum between $\bE_{\sv{i}}$ and the current $\gelm$, ensuring that at the conclusion of the procedure, no other edge length in $\bE$ will be shorter than $\gelm$.

Given the substantial impact of computing ${\ellstar}$, and the enormous number\footnote{``enormous'' $\approx2\cdot\left (|\bP|^{5\,\bar{n}}\right )$, because with increasing mesh densities, as the ratio of counts of faces to counts of points converges to two, the ratio of border to non-border edge lengths diminishes. This is described in detail in the Appendix~\ref{apdx1}.} of times an edge length is required in the computation of the \wmfv{s} per convolution of the filter, pre-calculating the set of all edge lengths $\bE$ outside of the principle loop becomes critical to the overall efficiency of the algorithm, despite the fact that it requires ${\ellstar}$ to be calculated and stored $|\bP|^{\bar{n}}$ times.

This pre-calculation is of paramount importance for two reasons. The first reason is that without pre-calcuating every edge length, it would be otherwise impossible to calculate the global minimum edge length $\gelm$, which is used $|\bP|^{4\,\bar{n}}$ times in every convolution of the filter. The second reason is that by recording the results of every $\ellstar$ calculation in the set $\bE$, we are then able to completely exclude any further calculations of $\ellstar$ from \gls{tPrinLoop}, and as can be seen in Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialConvolveFilter}, that reduces the total count of $\ellstar$ calculations performed by the filter from the $\tau^{|\bP|^{3\,\bar{n}}}$ had the procedure been required to calculate an edge length each time it was used during computation, down to only the initial $1\cdot |\bP|^{\bar{n}}$ pre-calculations, thus becoming completely independent of $\tau$ and significantly more efficient overall.%

\section{Convolving the Filter}
\label{ch4sCF}
Having discussed in Section~\ref{ch4sBN} the discovery and subsequent construction of the set of every one-ring neighborhood $\bN$, then in Section~\ref{ch4sCEL}, the set of pre-calculations of every edge length $\bE$, in this section, we present the third and final part of the serial algorithm for convolving \Fors{t}, describing the remaining steps required to convolve the filter over a mesh.

In Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialConvolveFilter}, the function \textit{convolveFilter} outlines how the convolutions of \fors{t} are performed for a user-defined number of times $\tau$, by convolving over each and every point $\bp_v$ in the set $\bP$. Then at each point, each neighboring point $\bp_i$ in the one-ring neighborhood $\bN_v$ is examined in order to calculate the \wmfv{} $\check{f}$, as described in detail in Sections~\ref{ch3sIA} -~\ref{ch3sWM}, at the center of gravity of the circle sector defined by $\bp_v$ and $\bp_i$. Next, the \wmfv{} $f'_v$ is evaluated as the average of all the \wmfv{s} from each circle sector comprising the geodesic disc $\bO_v$, and is stored  in set $\bF'$, before the filter finally progresses to the next point in the mesh and its corresponding one-ring neighborhood.  Afterwards, one may efficiently convolve the filter, for as many convolutions as are required to achieve the desired smoothing effect.

An experiment was conduncted to examine the effect on the filter response cause by this error, and the conclusion was that while the filter response was indeed different, it was typically very similar to the correct value.

While the performance of Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialConvolveFilter} is much improved by the neighborhood building and pre-calculations performed in Algorithms~\ref{alg:serialBuildNeighborhoods} and~\ref{alg:serialCalculateEdgeLengths}, its strictly-serial design prevents it from scaling in performance appropriately for the sizes of real-world, acquired \tdd{}, performing especially sluggishly\footnote{Among our experiments, the maximum time for the serial algorithm to complete was obtained when convolving a mesh comprised of $\approx$$9\times 10^6$ points for $3\times 10^3$ convolutions.

\section{Summary}
\label{ch4sDN}
In this chapter, we presented the serial algorithms for implementing the improved version of \Fors{t}, as implemented within the GigaMesh framework. In Section~\ref{ch4sATP}, we discussed the motivation for separating the algorithm into three parts, citing the substantial improvements to the over all efficiency of the filter. In Section~\ref{ch4sBN}, the considerations behind building a family of sets of neighborhoods are weighed, before presenting the function \textit{serialBuildNeighborhoods} in Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialBuildNeighborhoods}. Then in Section~\ref{ch4sCEL}, the significance of $\ellstar$ and the L2-norm calcuation is explained in context with modern implementations of the square root operation, before presenting function \textit{serialCalculateEdgeLengths} in Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialCalculateEdgeLengths}. Finally, in Section~\ref{ch4sCF}, Algorithm~\ref{alg:serialConvolveFilter} is presented with the function \textit{serialConvolveFilter}, which implements the principle loop for convolving the filter over a mesh, for as many convolutions as are required to achieve the desired smoothing effect.

Unfortunately, \Fors{t} is still entirely serial in design; therefore, in the next section, we will endeavor to explore this as-yet-unpublished algorithm in order to discover any manifestations of independent procedures worthy of exploiting with parallel processing, with the goal of improving the overall performance and scalability of the filter when it is implemented on a system capable of parallel computation.
