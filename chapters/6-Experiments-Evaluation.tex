\chapter{Experiments \& Evaluation}
Our goal in experimentation was two-fold. It was our intuition that it would be useful to visualize the filter response when applied to acquired \tdd{} with the result of the MSII applied, both regular and irregular synthetic \tdd{} with the Dirac delta function applied.

A smoothing filter is an application of the Heat equation \todoCitation{Jaehne}
Gaussian distribution
Gaussian blurring


Two purposes:
	1. see the behavior of the filter in different data sets, and to
	1. compare the speedup obtained on given different problem sizes and processor counts

Two kinds of data sets:
	synthetic
		square tessallations 2 and 4 triangles
		hexagonal tessalations
		circle triangulation
	acquired

\section{Synthetic Data}
In order to study the effect of each convolution of \fors{t} on individual values of a scalar field, we generated synthetic \tdd{} arranged into four different configuraitions of triangle meshes, then applied the Dirac delta function as a scalar field\todoCitation{Dirac delta function}, meaning a function value of one at the center point, and zero everywhere else, before iteravely convolving the filter multiple times on each mesh.

The four synthetic mesh configurations are: the bisected square tessellation, the quadrisected square tesselation, the hexagonal tessellation, and the radially bounded, uniformally distributed, delaney triangulated, random mesh, and were generated using C++ source code which was written specifically for the research presented in this thesis. However, as such tools may also be found useful by other researchers, it is our intention to make that source code of each generator as available to the others as this thesis is.

\subsection{Bisected Square Tessellation}
The synthetic mesh generator for bisected square tessellations generates meshes which are characterized by rings of squares around a center point, with the northwest and southest corners made adjacent as to bisect the square into two equally sized isosceles triangles. The smallest, non-trivial mesh, generated with the parameter R equal to one, is composed of only nine points and eight faces, but grows quickly as summarized in table~\ref{tbl:sq2}.

\subsection{Hexagonal Tesselation}
The synthetic mesh generator for hexagonal tessellations generates meshes which are characterized by rings of hexagons around one centeral hexagon, with each corner of a hexagon made adjacent to its center point, creating six equilateral triangles. The smallest mesh, generated with the parameter R equal to zero, is composed of only seven points and 6 faces, but grows quickly as summarized in table~\ref{tbl:hex}.

\textbf{R} & \textbf{Points} & \textbf{Faces} \\

\subsection{Random Trigangulated Circles}
The synthetic mesh generator for random trigangulated circles generates meshes which are characterized by radially bounded, uniformally distributed, delaney triangulated, random meshes. Unlike the other generators, this requires two parameters, the radius R, and the number of points P. The smallest mesh,



generated with the parameter R equal to zero, is composed of only seven points and 6 faces, but grows quickly as summarized in table~\ref{tbl:hex}.

\subsection{Compute Times}

Figure~\ref{fig:computeTimesLP} shows how compute times increase linearly with both mesh size and number of iterations in a very predictable way when total compute time is at least 0.1 seconds, and less predictable for shorter periods do to the nature of thread optimization at the processor level and variable memory read times.\todoResearch{add formula for timing (or at least ref to it) here.}\todoResearch{process time noise at very fast speeds}
