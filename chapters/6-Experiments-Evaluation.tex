\chapter{Experiments \& Evaluation}
Our goal in experimentation was two-fold. It was our intuition that it would be useful to visualize the filter response when applied to acquired \tdd{} with the result of the MSII filter applied as a scalar field, and when applied to both regular and irregular synthetic \tdd{} with the Dirac delta function applied. Secondly, the performance of the parallel algorithm is evaluated in regards to speedup obtained when convolving the filter over meshes of different sizes, with different counts of processors.

A smoothing filter is an application of the Heat equation \todoCitation{Jaehne}
Gaussian distribution
Gaussian blurring

Two purposes:
	1. see the behavior of the filter in different data sets, and to
	1. compare the speedup obtained on given different problem sizes and processor counts

Two kinds of data sets:
	synthetic
		square tessallations 2 and 4 triangles
		hexagonal tessalations
		circle triangulation
	acquired

Each image of a mesh was visualized using GigaMesh~\cite{Mara10} with function values colored with the Improved Hot colorramp, exported as a raster image in the portable network graphic, PNG, format.%after disabling the background grid [f7], maximizing the window, disabling screenshot cropping, as well as rejecting tiled rendering, finally cropping to content in GIMP.

\section{Synthetic Data}
In order to study the effect of each convolution of \fors{t} on individual values of a scalar field, we generated synthetic \tdd{} arranged into four different configuraitions of triangle meshes, then applied the Dirac delta function as a scalar field\todoCitation{Dirac delta function}, meaning a function value of one at the center point, and zero everywhere else, before iteravely convolving the filter multiple times on each mesh.

The four synthetic mesh configurations are: the bisected square tessellation, the quadrisected square tesselation, the hexagonal tessellation, and the random triangulated circle mesh, and were generated using C++ source code which was written specifically for the research presented in this thesis. However, as such tools may also be found useful by other researchers, it is our intention to make that source code of each generator as available as this thesis to the others.

\subsection{Bisected Square Tessellations}
The synthetic mesh generator for bisected square tessellations generates meshes which are characterized by rings of squares around a center point, with the northwest and southest corners made adjacent as to bisect the square into two equally sized isosceles triangles, creating two dissimilar edge lengths adjacent to the center point.

The smallest, non-trivial mesh, generated with the parameter R equal to one, is composed of four squares around the center point, represented in total by only nine points and eight faces, however those numbers grow quickly

with increasing parameter size R, according to the two equations

	|\bP| &= 4R^2 + 4R + 1 \\

Notice how the filter response appears to travel faster accross the image, along the longer, diagonal edge lengths.

\subsection{Random Trigangulated Circles}
The synthetic mesh generator for random trigangulated circles generates meshes which are characterized by radially bounded, uniformally distributed, delaney triangulated, random meshes. Unlike the other generators, this requires two parameters, the radius R, and the number of points P. The smallest mesh,



generated with the parameter R equal to zero, is composed of only seven points and 6 faces, but grows quickly as summarized in table~\ref{tbl:hex}.

Figure~\ref{fig:computeTimesLP} shows how compute times increase linearly with both mesh size and number of iterations in a very predictable way when total compute time is at least 0.1 seconds, and less predictable for shorter periods do to the nature of thread optimization at the processor level and variable memory read times.\todoResearch{add formula for timing (or at least ref to it) here.}\todoResearch{process time noise at very fast speeds}
