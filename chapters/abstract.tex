Motivated by the increasing importance of \tdd{} acquisition, and the difficulty  inherent to filtering noise from data, given the current techniques, this thesis presents \Fors{t} as a scalable solution to smoothing large meshes of \tdd{}, by utilizing commercially-available, General Purpose, Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs). The filter convolves over each one-ring neighborhood in the mesh, and calculates the \wmfv{s} of those neighborhood, by interpolating the function values toward the center point. Originally, the filter was implemented as a strictly-serial procedure, but this thesis presents an enhanced parallel variant of the algorithm, made possible by the introduction of GPGPUs. When tested in a battery of experiments including synthetic and acquired \tdd{}, while the efficiency remain at 15\% or below, the parallel variant achieved an increase in performance of upto 204\%.
