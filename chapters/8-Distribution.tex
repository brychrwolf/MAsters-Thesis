%Before CUDA 5.0, if a programmer wanted to call particle::advance() from a CUDA kernel launched in main.cpp, the compiler required the main.cpp compilation unit to include the implementation of particle::advance() as well any subroutines it calls (v3::normalize() and v3::scramble() in this case). In complex C++ applications, the call chain may go deeper than the two-levels that our exampleillustrates. Without device object linking, the developer may need to deviate from the conventional application structure to accommodate this compiler requirement. Such changes are difficult for existing applications in which changing the structure is invasive and/or undesirable.~\cite{Cuda14}In order to use the full functionality of GigaMesh a batch program has to be run for generating feature vectors. These vectors contain additional information per vertex concerning surface and volume of a set of spheres intersecting the mesh. See [MKJB10] for more background information on the Multi Scale Integral Invariant (MSII) filtering technique. This operation is rather time consuming (it takes hours or even days of computing time) and therefore better runs without graphical user interface. Although generating feature vectors is quite robust against solo vertices, singularities, non-manifolds and holes, you should first clean up your mesh data to get a proper result. So switch to the advanced task of polishing your mesh in section 4.1 and return to this section when you have got a cleaned mesh. If you do not want to manipulate your mesh you may continue directly. Open a terminal and type and change to the mesh-folder by typing cd GigaMesh/mesh (note that GigaMesh stands for the GigaMesh installation folder). Then start the program nohup ./meshgeneratorfeaturevectors25d\_threads -f [-r 2] \& and use nohup at the beginning of the command and \& at the end to ensure that the job runs in the background. This is because this step can take several hours and you do not want to block the terminal.~\cite[p.~19]{Giga17}
