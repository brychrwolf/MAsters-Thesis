Keep everythign local to my function. *make note about how to genrealize CUDA acceses, vs huberts decision*
build as library, only link to it in mesh/Makefile -> therefore pre-compiling in cuda directory will be required
must update .pro file and mesh/makefile
mesh.cpp will use CUDA DEFINES as found in qmake's .pro file

first visually verify output of algorithm with gigamesh
	load example file
	calculate distance to plane (or MSII)
	save FunctionValues to .mat file
	run Gigamesh algorithm once
	save new FunctionCalues to .mat file
	load .mat file into algorithm
	process once
	save new FunctionValues to .mat file...
	compare two processed files
	Visually compare two processed files.
	
	synthetic large flat plane, single high vetex, see gaussion curve after several iterations
