After a weekend of research, stress and pain I finally figure out how to install manjaro 17 and configure the nvidia/bumblebee drivers on my avell laptop

Here's my notebook specs:

$ inxi -MGCNA

Machine:   Device: laptop System: Avell High Performance product: 1513

           7: 2593 MHz 8: 2601 MHz

           Card-2: Intel Wireless 7265 driver: iwlwifi
The first problem occurred when booting the live usb with nonfree drivers, it simply hangs with the message A start job is running for LiveMedia MHWD Script. Possibly the Manjaro Hardware Detection(a.k.a MHWD) couldn't configure the correct drivers for this setup. I tryed some flags like xdriver=vesa, nouveau.modeset=0, and finally nomodeset that brings me a bit closer to the xserver session, but again it hangs now with the message Started TLP system startup/shutdown.

With some research I find the kernel flag systemd.mask=mhwd-live.service that brings me to the manjaro live session (blocks the mhwd from detecting the optimal drivers).

Then I start the installer and proceed with a normal installation but the installer again gets stuck now in 78% Running mhwdcfg, the screen simply freezes. To get arround this problem I restart and use the same flag described above to get into the live session and comment the run method on /lib/calamares/modules/mhwdcfg/main.py at the end of the file and repeat the installation again:

def run():
    """ Configure the hardware """
    
    mhwd = MhwdController()
    
    # return mhwd.run()
    return None # <- Add this and comment the above line
With this trick I finished the installation, restart and manjaro works fine!

First of all update your system with sudo pacman -Syu and once completed install the linux headers with sudo pacman -S linux49-headers(use your kernel version) then the non-free drivers with sudo mhwd -a pci nonfree 0300 and follow the bumblebee instruction from manjaro website. (https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php?title=Configure_NVIDIA_(non-free)_settings_and_load_them_on_Startup#Bumblebee_and_Steam)

Reboot the system and add the following kernel flags otherwise the system won't boot:

acpi_osi=! acpi_osi="Windows 2009"
Once you get into your graphical interface test if bumblebee is running correctly:

systemctl status bumblebeed
optirun -b none nvidia-settings -c :8
You should see the nvidia-settings showing your dedicated GPU, for me works like a charm!

Don't forget to add acpi_osi=! acpi_osi=\"Windows 2009\" to your GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT on /etc/default/grub and run sudo update-grub
