✓	2.5 archetures of cuncurrency
✓	2.1.-2.4 squash into meshes
✓	move related work to own chapter
✓	6 subsections definitions into background (motivation then theory, then work)
✓	add summamry subsections per chapter

✓	compare a diffusion process

Plots:
✓	just use log log for compute times
✓	color by mesh sizes
✓	scatter plot, size of point is mesh size or computation time
