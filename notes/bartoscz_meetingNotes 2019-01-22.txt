2.5 archetures of cuncurrency
2.1.-2.4 squash into meshes
move related work to own chapter
6 subsections definitions into background (motivation then theory, then work)
avoid all forward references
add summamry subsections per chapter
Move what is cuda to background
compare a diffusion process

just use log log for compute times
color by mesh sizes
scatter plot, size of point is mesh size or computation time

experiments = setup
