Hi All, 
After 2 days of trial & error, including taking advices from this thread, i've managed to install both the CUDA toolkit & visual studio integration. In the absence of a bugfix in the official installer, i consider this as a nearly perfect solution, and can't wait to share it with others here :-)

My environment: Win7 64 bit, Visual Studio 2015 Community update 3, CUDA Toolkit 9.1

Solution:
1. download the offline CUDA installer
2. extract the installation files
3. install CUDA except "visual studio integration"
4. manually copy the "visual studio integration" files into MSBuild's BuildCustomizations folder
5. edit your .vcxproj file to point to those customizations

for steps (4 & 5), see this blog post

Enjoy!
